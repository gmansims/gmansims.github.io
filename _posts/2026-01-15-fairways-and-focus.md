In golf, a round is played in discrete units: 18 holes. Each hole is its own challenge with a clear beginning and end. You can't play hole 14 while standing on hole 7.

This structure creates natural focus. For the 5-15 minutes you're playing a hole, that's all you're doing. Then you move to the next one.

## The Problem with Open-Ended Time

Most knowledge work has no holes. We have "work time"—an open field where everything blurs together. We start writing code, get a Slack message, review a document, return to code, check email, and wonder why we're exhausted without making progress.

This isn't deep work. It's wandering in the rough, hoping to stumble toward the green.

## Design Your Week Like a Golf Course

What if you structured your week like 18 holes? Discrete blocks of time, each with a clear purpose and end point.

Here's what that might look like:

- **90-minute blocks:** Deep work on a single project or problem
- **30-minute blocks:** Code review, feedback, collaborative work
- **15-minute blocks:** Quick decisions, admin tasks, planning
- **Clear transitions:** Brief pause between blocks (like walking to the next tee)

## Staying on the Fairway

In golf, the fairway is the ideal path. It's cut short, clear of obstacles, designed to let you make your next shot.

In work, staying on the fairway means:

- Protecting your focus blocks from interruptions
- Saying no to tasks that don't fit your current hole
- Batching similar work together
- Having a clear definition of "done" for each block

## When You End Up in the Rough

Even professional golfers miss fairways. When they do, they don't try to hit a miracle shot through the trees. They pitch back to the fairway and continue from there.

Same with work. When a focus block gets derailed:

1. Acknowledge it happened (don't pretend you're still focused)
2. Finish the interruption or capture it for later
3. Take a brief reset break (walk, water, window)
4. Return to your block with fresh attention

Don't try to muscle through distraction. Get back to the fairway first.

## Short Blocks, Clear Outcomes

You don't need four-hour marathon sessions to do deep work. A focused 90 minutes beats a distracted half-day every time.

The key is matching the block to the task:

- Architecture decisions: 90 minutes
- Feature implementation: 90 minutes
- Bug investigation: 60 minutes
- Code review: 30 minutes
- Team sync: 15 minutes

## Building the Habit

Start with one deep work block per day. Same time, same type of work, same duration. Build the routine until it becomes automatic.

Then add a second block. Then a third. Like learning to play golf—you don't start by playing 18 holes. You practice one swing at a time.

The goal is simple: design your week so your attention stays on the fairway, not wandering in the rough.
