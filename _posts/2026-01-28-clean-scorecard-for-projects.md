Every golfer keeps a scorecard. It's simple: 18 holes, par for each hole, your score for each hole. At the end of the round, you know exactly how you did.

Projects should work the same way. But instead, we often start with vague goals, shift priorities mid-stream, and finish without knowing if we succeeded.

## The Three Elements of a Good Scorecard

A golf scorecard has three critical elements that make it useful:

### 1. Clear Par (The Expected Outcome)

Before you play a hole, you know what par is. You know a birdie is good, a bogey is slightly off, and a double bogey means something went wrong.

Your project needs the same clarity. What does success look like? What's good enough? What's exceptional? Define par before you start.

### 2. Visible Constraints

On a scorecard, you can see the hole's distance, the hazards, the difficulty rating. You know what you're working with.

Projects need visible constraints too: timeline, budget, team size, technical limitations. Make them explicit. Write them down. Keep them visible.

### 3. Honest Scoring

In golf, you count every stroke. No gimmes on the scorecard. This honesty is what makes the score meaningful.

In projects, be honest about progress. Don't round "almost done" up to "done." Don't hide the extra time spent debugging. Track the actual effort, not the ideal effort.

## A Simple Project Scorecard Template

Here's a lightweight framework you can adapt:

- **Goal:** What are we building? (One clear sentence)
- **Par:** What does success look like?
- **Constraints:** Time, budget, team, tech stack
- **Hazards:** Known risks and dependencies
- **Score:** How are we tracking? (Update weekly)

## Reviewing Your Scorecard

At the end of a golf round, you review your scorecard. You see which holes went well and which didn't. You learn.

Do the same with projects. When you finish (or abandon) a project, review the scorecard:

- Did we hit par? Why or why not?
- Which constraints held? Which changed?
- Which hazards materialized? Which didn't?
- What would we do differently next time?

## Keep It Simple

A golf scorecard fits on a single piece of paper. It's not a detailed analysis—it's a tracking tool.

Your project scorecard should be the same. One page. Clear. Visible. Updated regularly. If it takes more than five minutes to update, it's too complex.

The goal isn't perfect planning. It's having enough structure to know where you stand and whether you're moving in the right direction.
