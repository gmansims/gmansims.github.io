Note, this is under construction. Coming soon!

This practice isn't glamorous. There's no gallery watching. No leaderboard. No prize money. But without it, championship golf would be impossible.

## Practice vs. Performance

In work, we often blur the line between practice and performance. Every commit is production code. Every design is for a real project. Every decision has immediate consequences.

This creates two problems:

1. We never get better because we're always performing
2. Performance suffers because we haven't practiced enough

Professionals in any field separate these modes. Musicians practice scales. Athletes drill fundamentals. Writers do morning pages. The practice isn't the performance—it makes the performance possible.

## What Practice Looks Like for Builders

For people who build things—code, designs, systems, products—practice might include:

- Coding katas or small exercises focused on technique
- Rebuilding familiar projects with new approaches
- Studying and recreating excellent work from others
- Writing throwaway prototypes to explore ideas
- Refactoring old code for the learning, not the outcome
- Reading documentation and implementing examples
