<article class="card">
  <p>Every golfer keeps a scorecard. It’s simple: 18 holes, par for each hole, your score for each hole. At the end of the round, you know exactly how you did.</p>

<p>Projects should work the same way. But instead, we often start with vague goals, shift priorities mid-stream, and finish without knowing if we succeeded.</p>

<h2 id="the-three-elements-of-a-good-scorecard">The Three Elements of a Good Scorecard</h2>

<p>A golf scorecard has three critical elements that make it useful:</p>

<h3 id="1-clear-par-the-expected-outcome">1. Clear Par (The Expected Outcome)</h3>

<p>Before you play a hole, you know what par is. You know a birdie is good, a bogey is slightly off, and a double bogey means something went wrong.</p>

<p>Your project needs the same clarity. What does success look like? What’s good enough? What’s exceptional? Define par before you start.</p>

<h3 id="2-visible-constraints">2. Visible Constraints</h3>

<p>On a scorecard, you can see the hole’s distance, the hazards, the difficulty rating. You know what you’re working with.</p>

<p>Projects need visible constraints too: timeline, budget, team size, technical limitations. Make them explicit. Write them down. Keep them visible.</p>

<h3 id="3-honest-scoring">3. Honest Scoring</h3>

<p>In golf, you count every stroke. No gimmes on the scorecard. This honesty is what makes the score meaningful.</p>

<p>In projects, be honest about progress. Don’t round “almost done” up to “done.” Don’t hide the extra time spent debugging. Track the actual effort, not the ideal effort.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-project-scorecard-template">A Simple Project Scorecard Template</h2>

<p>Here’s a lightweight framework you can adapt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal:</strong> What are we building? (One clear sentence)</li>
  <li><strong>Par:</strong> What does success look like?</li>
  <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Time, budget, team, tech stack</li>
  <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Known risks and dependencies</li>
  <li><strong>Score:</strong> How are we tracking? (Update weekly)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reviewing-your-scorecard">Reviewing Your Scorecard</h2>

<p>At the end of a golf round, you review your scorecard. You see which holes went well and which didn’t. You learn.</p>

<p>Do the same with projects. When you finish (or abandon) a project, review the scorecard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did we hit par? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Which constraints held? Which changed?</li>
  <li>Which hazards materialized? Which didn’t?</li>
  <li>What would we do differently next time?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep It Simple</h2>

<p>A golf scorecard fits on a single piece of paper. It’s not a detailed analysis—it’s a tracking tool.</p>

<p>Your project scorecard should be the same. One page. Clear. Visible. Updated regularly. If it takes more than five minutes to update, it’s too complex.</p>

<p>The goal isn’t perfect planning. It’s having enough structure to know where you stand and whether you’re moving in the right direction.</p>
