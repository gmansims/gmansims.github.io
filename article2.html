          <p>
            Every golfer keeps a scorecard. It's simple: 18 holes, par for each hole, your score for each hole. At the end of the round, you know exactly how you did.
          </p>

          <p>
            Projects should work the same way. But instead, we often start with vague goals, shift priorities mid-stream, and finish without knowing if we succeeded.
          </p>

          <h2>The Three Elements of a Good Scorecard</h2>

          <p>
            A golf scorecard has three critical elements that make it useful:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Clear Par (The Expected Outcome)</h3>

          <p>
            Before you play a hole, you know what par is. You know a birdie is good, a bogey is slightly off, and a double bogey means something went wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your project needs the same clarity. What does success look like? What's good enough? What's exceptional? Define par before you start.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Visible Constraints</h3>

          <p>
            On a scorecard, you can see the hole's distance, the hazards, the difficulty rating. You know what you're working with.
          </p>

          <p>
            Projects need visible constraints too: timeline, budget, team size, technical limitations. Make them explicit. Write them down. Keep them visible.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Honest Scoring</h3>

          <p>
            In golf, you count every stroke. No gimmes on the scorecard. This honesty is what makes the score meaningful.
          </p>

          <p>
            In projects, be honest about progress. Don't round "almost done" up to "done." Don't hide the extra time spent debugging. Track the actual effort, not the ideal effort.
          </p>

          <h2>A Simple Project Scorecard Template</h2>

          <p>
            Here's a lightweight framework you can adapt:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> What are we building? (One clear sentence)</li>
            <li><strong>Par:</strong> What does success look like?</li>
            <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Time, budget, team, tech stack</li>
            <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Known risks and dependencies</li>
            <li><strong>Score:</strong> How are we tracking? (Update weekly)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Reviewing Your Scorecard</h2>

          <p>
            At the end of a golf round, you review your scorecard. You see which holes went well and which didn't. You learn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do the same with projects. When you finish (or abandon) a project, review the scorecard:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Did we hit par? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Which constraints held? Which changed?</li>
            <li>Which hazards materialized? Which didn't?</li>
            <li>What would we do differently next time?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Keep It Simple</h2>

          <p>
            A golf scorecard fits on a single piece of paper. It's not a detailed analysis—it's a tracking tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your project scorecard should be the same. One page. Clear. Visible. Updated regularly. If it takes more than five minutes to update, it's too complex.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal isn't perfect planning. It's having enough structure to know where you stand and whether you're moving in the right direction.
          </p>
