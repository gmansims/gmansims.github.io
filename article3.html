          <p>
            In golf, a round is played in discrete units: 18 holes. Each hole is its own challenge with a clear beginning and end. You can't play hole 14 while standing on hole 7.
          </p>

          <p>
            This structure creates natural focus. For the 5-15 minutes you're playing a hole, that's all you're doing. Then you move to the next one.
          </p>

          <h2>The Problem with Open-Ended Time</h2>

          <p>
            Most knowledge work has no holes. We have "work time"—an open field where everything blurs together. We start writing code, get a Slack message, review a document, return to code, check email, and wonder why we're exhausted without making progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            This isn't deep work. It's wandering in the rough, hoping to stumble toward the green.
          </p>

          <h2>Design Your Week Like a Golf Course</h2>

          <p>
            What if you structured your week like 18 holes? Discrete blocks of time, each with a clear purpose and end point.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's what that might look like:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>90-minute blocks:</strong> Deep work on a single project or problem</li>
            <li><strong>30-minute blocks:</strong> Code review, feedback, collaborative work</li>
            <li><strong>15-minute blocks:</strong> Quick decisions, admin tasks, planning</li>
            <li><strong>Clear transitions:</strong> Brief pause between blocks (like walking to the next tee)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Staying on the Fairway</h2>

          <p>
            In golf, the fairway is the ideal path. It's cut short, clear of obstacles, designed to let you make your next shot.
          </p>

          <p>
            In work, staying on the fairway means:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Protecting your focus blocks from interruptions</li>
            <li>Saying no to tasks that don't fit your current hole</li>
            <li>Batching similar work together</li>
            <li>Having a clear definition of "done" for each block</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When You End Up in the Rough</h2>

          <p>
            Even professional golfers miss fairways. When they do, they don't try to hit a miracle shot through the trees. They pitch back to the fairway and continue from there.
          </p>

          <p>
            Same with work. When a focus block gets derailed:
          </p>

          <ol class="list">
            <li>Acknowledge it happened (don't pretend you're still focused)</li>
            <li>Finish the interruption or capture it for later</li>
            <li>Take a brief reset break (walk, water, window)</li>
            <li>Return to your block with fresh attention</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Don't try to muscle through distraction. Get back to the fairway first.
          </p>

          <h2>Short Blocks, Clear Outcomes</h2>

          <p>
            You don't need four-hour marathon sessions to do deep work. A focused 90 minutes beats a distracted half-day every time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The key is matching the block to the task:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Architecture decisions: 90 minutes</li>
            <li>Feature implementation: 90 minutes</li>
            <li>Bug investigation: 60 minutes</li>
            <li>Code review: 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Team sync: 15 minutes</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Building the Habit</h2>

          <p>
            Start with one deep work block per day. Same time, same type of work, same duration. Build the routine until it becomes automatic.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then add a second block. Then a third. Like learning to play golf—you don't start by playing 18 holes. You practice one swing at a time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The goal is simple: design your week so your attention stays on the fairway, not wandering in the rough.
          </p>
