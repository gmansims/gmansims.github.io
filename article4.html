            Before tournament week, professional golfers spend hours on the practice range. Not playing for score. Not competing. Just hitting balls, refining their swing, building muscle memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            This practice isn't glamorous. There's no gallery watching. No leaderboard. No prize money. But without it, championship golf would be impossible.
          </p>

          <h2>Practice vs. Performance</h2>

          <p>
            In work, we often blur the line between practice and performance. Every commit is production code. Every design is for a real project. Every decision has immediate consequences.
          </p>

          <p>
            This creates two problems:
          </p>

          <ol class="list">
            <li>We never get better because we're always performing</li>
            <li>Performance suffers because we haven't practiced enough</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Professionals in any field separate these modes. Musicians practice scales. Athletes drill fundamentals. Writers do morning pages. The practice isn't the performance—it makes the performance possible.
          </p>

          <h2>What Practice Looks Like for Builders</h2>

          <p>
            For people who build things—code, designs, systems, products—practice might include:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Coding katas or small exercises focused on technique</li>
            <li>Rebuilding familiar projects with new approaches</li>
            <li>Studying and recreating excellent work from others</li>
            <li>Writing throwaway prototypes to explore ideas</li>
            <li>Refactoring old code for the learning, not the outcome</li>
            <li>Reading documentation and implementing examples</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The key characteristic: the work itself is the goal, not what the work produces.
          </p>

          <h2>Building a Practice Ritual</h2>

          <p>
            A ritual has structure. It's not "practice when I feel like it." It's a repeatable routine that signals to your brain: this is practice time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here's a simple framework:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Fixed Time and Duration</h3>

          <p>
            Morning works well—30-60 minutes before "real" work starts. But any consistent time works. The duration should be short enough to sustain daily, long enough to get into flow.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Focused Scope</h3>

          <p>
            Don't practice everything. Pick one thing: algorithm practice, design patterns, test-driven development, performance optimization, documentation writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Focus on that thing for a month. Then move to the next thing. Deep practice beats scattered effort.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Low Stakes</h3>

          <p>
            Practice should feel safe. No one sees it. No one judges it. It doesn't go to production. This psychological safety is what allows real learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Create a "practice" folder. Use a separate repository. Work in a private notebook. Make it clear: this is the range, not the course.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Immediate Feedback</h3>

          <p>
            Good practice includes feedback loops. Tests that pass or fail. Code that runs or errors. Metrics that improve or don't.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without feedback, practice is just motion, not progress.
          </p>

          <h2>What to Practice</h2>

          <p>
            Your practice should focus on fundamentals and weak spots:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Fundamentals:</strong> The basics that support everything else (clean code, testing, documentation, problem decomposition)</li>
            <li><strong>Weak spots:</strong> Skills you avoid because they're uncomfortable (performance optimization, accessibility, security, public speaking)</li>
            <li><strong>New techniques:</strong> Tools and approaches you want to add to your repertoire</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When Practice Feels Like a Luxury</h2>

          <p>
            During busy seasons, practice time feels impossible. There's too much real work. Too many deadlines. Too much pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is exactly when professionals practice most. Tiger Woods didn't skip the range during major championship weeks. He hit more balls, not fewer.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you're busy:
          </p>

          <ul class="list">
            <li>Practice can be 15 minutes instead of 60</li>
            <li>Practice can be deliberate work on today's actual problems</li>
            <li>Practice can be reviewing what you built and asking how to do it better</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The ritual survives by adapting, not by being rigid.
          </p>

          <h2>The Long Game</h2>

          <p>
            Practice doesn't show results today. That's the point.
          </p>

          <p>
            A golfer practicing putting for an hour won't see improvement in that hour. But after a month, the improvement is undeniable. After a year, it's transformative.
          </p>

          <p>
            The same timeline applies to your craft. Daily practice feels small. Six months of daily practice changes everything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Build the ritual. Trust the process. Show up to the range.
          </p>
